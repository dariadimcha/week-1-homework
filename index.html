        <h3>The Who</h3>
        <p align="justify">
          I’m <em>Daria</em>, a wandering soul from the charming corners of
          Moldova, here to share a bit of my story with you. Picture this: a
          small-town child who somehow ended up diving deep into the world of
          finance. Funny how life works, right?
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="how">
        <h3>The How</h3>
        <p align="justify">
          I hold a Ph.D. in Finance, a Master's in Banking and Finance, and a
          Bachelor's in International Business. Fancy titles (are they really?!)
          but what sets me apart is my unyielding curiosity and passion for
          understanding the intricacies of numbers.
          <br />
          You see, I didn’t start out aiming to decipher balance sheets and
          create financial models. My heart initially leaned towards a life as a
          diplomat, exploring the world, and soaking in diverse cultures. But
          well, life had its plans, and I found myself captivated by the
          analytical challenges of the financial realm.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="what">
        <h3>The What</h3>
        <p align="justify">
          I’m that person who gets lost in the details, finding beauty in the
          complexity. One of my proudest moments? Building a working prototype
          of a sentiment analysis scale with my amazing colleagues. It's not
          just a project; it's a testament to our teamwork and determination.
          <br />
          Challenges? Bring them on! I believe they're like puzzles, waiting to
          be solved. But hey, I’ve learned the importance of balance too. It’s
          not just about work. I find solace in my sketches; animals and
          landscapes are my favorite subjects. Crochet and crafts? Count me in.
          And oh, traveling? An adventure I never say no to.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="why">
        <h3>The Why</h3>
        <p align="justify">
          I owe my work ethic to my mother, a strong, determined woman who
          taught me the value of hard work. Despite my degrees, I find wisdom in
          unexpected places; for instance, Rafiki, the wise old philosopher, who
          still is my spirit guide.
          <br />
          Looking ahead, I’m on a mission. I want to speak the language of the
          digital age, understand the IT world a bit better. It’s not about
          changing who I am, but about expanding my horizons. And introverts? We
          have a voice too, and I'm here to make sure it’s heard.
